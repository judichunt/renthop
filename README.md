xgboost sklearn nltk

tocsv : extract the words (v, adj, adv) in description and features to cleaned
        and then write in a new json or csv

classification : use cleaned to classify interest_level

words : find the rate of a word in different interest_level

xgb : use xgboost to research the rate in interest_level 

we can use "words" to decide if a word should be added as a feature in "xgb"
